      In this general connectivity Object, the Resources are limited to the

      read the description, which refers to relevant standard development
      organizations (e.g. 3GPP, IEEE).

      The goal of the Connectivity Monitoring Object is to carry information
      reflecting the more up to date values of the current connection for
      monitoring purposes. Resources such as Link Quality, Radio Signal
      Strength, Cell ID are retrieved during connected mode at least for
      cellular networks.

    Name: Firmware Update
    Description: &gt;-
      This LwM2M Object enables management of firmware which is to be updated.
      This Object includes installing a firmware package, updating firmware,
      and performing actions after updating firmware. The firmware update MAY
      require to reboot the device; it will depend on a number of factors,
      such as the operating system architecture and the extent of the updated
      software.

      The envisioned functionality is to allow a LwM2M Client to connect to
      any LwM2M Server to obtain a firmware image using the object and
      resource structure defined in this section experiencing communication
      security protection using TLS/DTLS. There are, however, other design
      decisions that need to be taken into account to allow a manufacturer of
      a device to securely install firmware on a device. Examples for such
      design decisions are how to manage the firmware update repository at the
      server side (which may include user interface considerations), the
      techniques to provide additional application layer security protection
      of the firmware image, how many versions of firmware images to store on
      the device, and how to execute the firmware update process considering
      the hardware specific details of a given IoT hardware product. These
      aspects are considered to be outside the scope of this version of the
      specification.

      A LwM2M Server may also instruct a LwM2M Client to fetch a firmware
      image from a dedicated server (instead of pushing firmware images to the
      LwM2M Client). The Package URI resource is contained in the Firmware
      object and can be used for this purpose.

      A LwM2M Client MUST support block-wise transfer [CoAP_Blockwise] if it
      implements the Firmware Update object.

      A LwM2M Server MUST support block-wise transfer. Other protocols, such
      as HTTP/HTTPs, MAY also be used for downloading firmware updates (via
      the Package URI resource). For constrained devices it is, however,
      RECOMMENDED to use CoAP for firmware downloads to avoid the need for
      additional protocol implementations.

      - Using a single instance for both directions communication, from Client to Server and from Server to Client.
      - Using an instance for communication from Client to Server and another one for communication from Server to Client
      - Using several instances

    URN: 'urn:oma:lwm2m:x:10311'
    Name: Solar Radiation
    Description: &gt;-
      This Object is used to report solar irradiance (SI), i.e. power per unit
      area received from the Sun in the form of electromagnetic radiation, on
      a planar surface measured by a pyranometer or similar instrument. A
      pyranometer measures solar irradiance from the hemisphere above within a
      wavelength range 0.3 um to 3 um. For example, the application of solar
      radiation measurement can be meterological networks and solar energy
      applications.

    Name: Particulates
    Description: &gt;-
      This object should be used to report the concentration of particulates,
      for example a measurement of a particulates air quality sensor.  It also
      provides resources for minimum/maximum measured values and the
      minimum/maximum range that can be measured by the particulate sensor. An
      example measurement unit is microgrammes per cubic metre ug/m3.
